Here's a breakdown of the translation:

- ""La première"" means ""the first""
- ""découverte majeure"" means ""major discovery"" or ""main achievement""
- ""réalisée"" means ""made"" or ""performed""
- ""avec le télescope"" means ""with the telescope""
- ""est faite"" means ""is made"" or ""is achieved""
- ""au moment"" means ""at the time"" or ""when""
- ""de sa mise en service"" means ""of its installation"" or ""of its activation""
- ""en 2004"" means ""in the year 2004""

So, the sentence is describing a significant event that occurred when the telescope was first put into operation in 2004."
"Elle concerne Procyon, une des étoiles les plus étudiées par les astronomes : alors que l'on s'attend à voir l'astre vibrer, on constate qu'il n'en est rien.","It concerns Procyon, one of the most studied stars by astronomers: while we expect to see the star vibrate, we find that it does not.","This concerns Procyon, one of the stars most studied by astronomers: while one would expect the star to vibrate, it is observed that this is not the case.","Here's the translation of the French text to English:

It concerns Procyon, one of the most studied stars by astronomers: while we expect the star to vibrate, we find out it is not.

Procyon (Mira Borealis) is actually a Mira variable, which means that it does undergo periodic variations in brightness. However, the term ""vibrate"" was not the most accurate translation, as it often implies a change in frequency, whereas in astrophysics, the term ""oscillate"" or ""vary"" is more commonly used to describe such phenomena."
"En 2005, MOST est responsable d'une seconde découverte étonnante : on observe pour la première fois une planète géante qui orbite si près de son étoile hôte que celle-ci se voit forcée de synchroniser sa rotation avec la planète.","In 2005, MOST was responsible for a second astonishing discovery: for the first time, a giant planet was observed orbiting so close to its host star that the star was forced to synchronize its rotation with the planet.","In 2005, MOST was responsible for a second astonishing discovery: for the first time, a giant planet was observed orbiting so close to its host star that the star was forced to synchronize its rotation with the planet.","Here's the translation of the French text to English:

In 2005, MOST made a second astonishing discovery: for the first time, a giant planet is observed to be orbiting so close to its host star that the star is compelled to synchronize its rotation with the planet.

""He reached the rank of Lieutenant Commander while continuing his work in astronomy and publishing several important scientific articles.""

Here's a breakdown of the translation:

- ""Il y atteint"" = ""He reached""
- ""le rang de lieutenant commandeur"" = ""the rank of Lieutenant Commander"" (the title and rank within the French Navy's officer corps)
- ""tout en"" = ""while"" or ""in addition to""
- ""poursuivant ses travaux en astronomie"" = ""continuing his work in astronomy"" (literally ""in astronomy"")
- ""en publiant plusieurs articles scientifiques importants"" = ""by publishing several important scientific articles""

Note: The term ""cycle carbone-azote"" can be translated to English as ""carbon-nitrogen cycle"" or ""CN cycle"", with the latter being a more common and widely accepted term in astrophysics."
"Le cycle CN, dont l'existence fut prédite 10 ans plus tôt, est à l'origine d'une réaction nucléaire combinant le carbone à l'azote et libérant une grande quantité d'énergie.","The CN cycle, whose existence was predicted 10 years earlier, is responsible for a nuclear reaction that combines carbon with nitrogen and releases a large amount of energy.","The CN cycle, whose existence was predicted 10 years earlier, is the source of a nuclear reaction combining carbon and nitrogen and releasing a large amount of energy.","The text translates to:

Note: CN is not a typical chemical notation, but in this context, it is likely referring to the carbon-nitrogen cycle, which is a process in nuclear biology and ecology where carbon and nitrogen are exchanged between organisms."
"Selon la théorie, c'est cette énergie qui anime les étoiles carbonées froides.","According to the theory, it is this energy that powers cold carbon stars.","According to the theory, it is this energy that powers cold carbon stars.","The translation of the French text to English is:

Note: ""les étoiles carbonées"" refers to carbon stars, which are a type of star that is composed mainly of carbon and has a low surface temperature, making them appear cold to the eye."

The same year, he moved to Ottawa, Ontario, and participated in the war effort by contributing to the development of new radar systems at the Canadian National Research Council.

Note: ""Effort de guerre"" can also be translated to ""war effort"" or ""wartime effort"", but I used ""war effort"" to make the translation more idiomatic."
"Après la guerre, Covington propose comme projet de recherche de convertir des surplus d'équipements radars pour étudier les ondes radio cosmiques.","After the war, Covington proposes a research project to convert surplus radar equipment to study cosmic radio waves.","After the war, Covington proposed as a research project the conversion of surplus radar equipment to study cosmic radio waves.","After the war, Covington proposed a research project to convert surplus radar equipment to study cosmic radio waves."
"Afin de calibrer son appareil, il décide de mesurer le flux de radiations en provenance du Soleil.","In order to calibrate his device, he decides to measure the flow of radiation coming from the Sun.","In order to calibrate his apparatus, he decides to measure the radiation flux coming from the Sun.","The translation of the French text to English is:

In order to calibrate his equipment, he decides to measure the radiation flow coming from the Sun.

Here's a breakdown of the translation:

- ""Afin"" is a preposition meaning ""in order to"" or ""so that"".
- ""de calibrer son appareil"" means ""to calibrate his equipment"".
- ""il"" is a pronoun referring to the subject of the sentence, ""he"".
- ""décide"" is the verb ""to decide"".
- ""de mesurer le flux de radiations"" means ""to measure the radiation flow"".
- ""en provenance du Soleil"" means ""coming from the Sun"".

So the complete translation is: ""In order to calibrate his equipment, he decides to measure the radiation flow coming from the Sun."""
Il commence à collecter des mesures en juillet 1946 et constate rapidement que le flux varie de jour en jour.,He begins to collect measurements in July 1946 and quickly notices that the flow varies from day to day.,He began collecting measurements in July 1946 and quickly observed that the flow varied from day to day.,"The translation of the French text to English is:

He begins to collect measurements in July 1946 and realizes quickly that the flow varies from day to day."
"Incapable d'expliquer si ces variations sont dues à ses instruments de mesure ou aux taches sombres que l'on retrouve à la surface du Soleil, il profite de l'éclipse partielle de Soleil du 23 novembre 1946 pour vérifier si l'obscurcissement d'une tache solaire par la Lune ne produirait pas une variation du flux de radiation.","Unable to explain whether these variations are due to his measuring instruments or to the dark spots found on the surface of the Sun, he takes advantage of the partial solar eclipse on November 23, 1946, to investigate whether the obscuration of a sunspot by the Moon would not produce a variation in the radiation flux.","Unable to explain whether these variations were due to his measuring instruments or the dark spots found on the surface of the Sun, he took advantage of the partial solar eclipse of November 23, 1946, to check whether the obscuring of a sunspot by the Moon would not produce a variation in the radiation flux.","Here's the translation:

""Incapable of explaining whether these variations are due to his measurement instruments or to the dark spots that can be found on the surface of the Sun, he takes advantage of the partial solar eclipse on November 23, 1946, to check if the obscuring of a solar spot by the Moon would not produce a variation in the radiation flux.""

Note that the text refers to solar eclipses in the French original, and uses the word ""obscurcissement"" to describe the effect of the Moon's shadow on the Sun's surface. If you want to translate it to English, I would suggest using the word ""darkening"" or ""shading"" instead of ""obscurcissement""."
"À son grand étonnement, il constate que la partie moins brillante marquée de taches solaires sombres émet des radiations beaucoup plus fortes que la partie non troublée et brillante du Soleil.","To his great astonishment, he observes that the less bright part marked by dark sunspots emits much stronger radiation than the undisturbed and bright part of the Sun.","To his great astonishment, he observes that the less bright part, marked by dark sunspots, emits much stronger radiation than the undisturbed, bright part of the Sun.","The translation of the French text to English is:

To his great astonishment, he discovers that the less radiant part marked by sunspots dark spots emits much more powerful radiation than the untroubled and bright part of the sun."
Il fournit alors la première preuve directe que les taches solaires sont associées à des sources chaudes de radiations.,It then provides the first direct evidence that sunspots are associated with hot sources of radiation.,He then provided the first direct evidence that sunspots are associated with hot radiation sources.,"Here is the translation of the French text to English:

""He then provides the first direct evidence that solar spots are associated with hot sources of radiation.""

Alternatively, you could also translate it as:

""He then provides the first evidence that solar spots originate from hot radiation sources.""

The word ""preuves"" in the original text is translated as ""evidence"" in English, and ""radiations"" is translated as ""radiation"" because in this context, it is likely referring to visible radiation, rather than radioactivity."
"Encouragé par cette découverte, Covington commence en février 1947 la collecte journalière de données sur le flux de radiations solaires et réussit à démontrer que le nombre de taches solaires est relié au flux de radiations du Soleil.","Encouraged by this discovery, Covington started in February 1947 the daily collection of data on the flow of solar radiation and managed to demonstrate that the number of sunspots is related to the flow of radiation from the Sun.","Encouraged by this discovery, in February 1947 Covington began the daily collection of data on solar radiation flux and succeeded in demonstrating a relationship between the number of sunspots and the Sun's radiation flux.","Here's the translation of the French text to English:

Encouraged by this discovery, Covington began collecting daily data on solar radiation in February 1947 and successfully demonstrated that the number of solar flares is related to the radiation levels of the Sun.

Note: I used the term ""solar flares"" to translate ""taches solaires"" because it's a more common English term for these events, and it seems to be the most accurate translation in this context."
Son programme de collecte de données se poursuit d'ailleurs sans interruption depuis cette période et ses mesures sont utilisées dans le monde entier.,"Its data collection program has been ongoing without interruption since that time, and its measures are being used worldwide.","Its data collection program has continued uninterrupted since that time, and its measurements are used worldwide.","The translation of the given French text to English is:

His data collection program, however, continues uninterrupted from this period, and his measures are used all over the world.

Note: The word ""Sa"" should be translated to ""His"" since ""ceux"" (they) would refer to a group, not the speaker, and ""sa"" (her/hers) would refer to a female subject."
"En 1951, il construit un appareil qui permet de détecter les radiations émises à partir de régions spécifiques à la surface du Soleil.","In 1951, he built a device that detects radiation emitted from specific regions on the surface of the Sun.","In 1951, he built a device that could detect radiation emitted from specific regions on the surface of the Sun.","The translation of the French text to English is:

In 1951, he built an instrument that allows for the detection of radiation emitted from specific regions on the surface of the Sun."
Il parvient ainsi à mesurer la brillance de la couronne solaire (la partie la plus externe de l'atmosphère du Soleil) et la température (soit environ 1 500 000 °C) de régions situées au-dessus des taches solaires.,"He is thus able to measure the brightness of the solar corona (the outermost part of the Sun's atmosphere) and the temperature (about 1,500,000 °C) of regions located above sunspots.","He thus succeeded in measuring the brightness of the solar corona (the outermost part of the Sun's atmosphere) and the temperature (approximately 1,500,000 °C) of regions located above sunspots.","The translation of the French text to English is:

He managed to measure the brilliance of the coronal solar (the outermost part of the Sun's atmosphere), and the temperature (approximately 1,500,000°C) of regions above sunspots."
Ses travaux contribueront à notre compréhension des mécanismes responsables de la formation des taches solaires.,His work will contribute to our understanding of the mechanisms responsible for the formation of sunspots.,His/Her work will contribute to our understanding of the mechanisms responsible for the formation of sunspots.,"The translation of the French text to English is:

His work will contribute to our understanding of the mechanisms responsible for the formation of solar spots.

Alternatively, a more literal translation could be:

His work will contribute to our understanding of the mechanisms that create solar spots.

However, the first translation is more idiomatic and clear in its meaning."
"Covington parvient à démontrer que l'intensité des radiations solaires est reliée à l'activité magnétique du Soleil, ce qui a des implications cruciales pour de nombreuses activités humaines comme les communications, les lignes de transport d'énergie, les prévisions climatiques, l'agriculture, les pêcheries, l'exploration spatiale, les satellites artificiels, la géophysique, etc.","Covington manages to demonstrate that the intensity of solar radiation is linked to the magnetic activity of the Sun, which has crucial implications for many human activities such as communications, energy transmission lines, weather forecasting, agriculture, fisheries, space exploration, artificial satellites, geophysics, and more.","Covington succeeded in demonstrating that the intensity of solar radiation is linked to the Sun's magnetic activity, which has crucial implications for numerous human activities such as communications, power transmission lines, weather forecasting, agriculture, fisheries, space exploration, artificial satellites, geophysics, etc.","Here is the translation of the French text to English:

""Hutchings first specialized in the study of the atmospheres of 'OB-type stars', that is, the very blue and very hot blue stars.""

Note: An ""étoile OB"" is an astronomical term used to classify red supergiants stars, due to their extreme luminosity. In the context of this sentence, Hutchings likely was studying atmospheres of extremely luminous stars similar to these red supergiants, but the text says ""bleues""."

""In 1968, he discovered that these stars, which have very thick atmospheres, emit hot stellar winds.""

However, it's worth noting that the term ""vents stellaires"" can also be translated to ""stellar winds"" without the adjective ""chauds"" (hot). The phrase ""vents stellaires chauds"" is more literal, but ""stellar winds"" or ""star winds"" is a widely accepted translation in English.

So, both translations are acceptable:

1. In 1968, he discovered that these stars, which have very thick atmospheres, emit stellar winds.
2. In 1968, he discovered that these stars, which have very thick atmospheres, emit hot stellar winds."

""Just a year later, in 1984, he makes a second major discovery: he proves, with David Crampton and Bruce Campbell, that quasars are the nuclei of active galaxies.""

Note that the French phrase ""des coeurs"" (hearts) is used to translate ""des nœuds"" or ""des centres"" (cores or centers), and the word ""actif"" is translated to English as ""active""."
Les galaxies actives sont des galaxies possédant un coeur qui émet de grandes quantités d'énergie.,Active galaxies are galaxies that have a core that emits large amounts of energy.,Active galaxies are galaxies with a core that emits large amounts of energy.,"The translation of the French text to English is:

Note: There is a slight error in the translation, as ""la Voie lactée"" is the Latin name for the Milky Way, and ""galaxie"" should be translated as ""galaxy"". The phrase ""la Voie lactée"" is often used in French to refer specifically to the Milky Way, but in this context, it is more accurate to use ""galaxy""."

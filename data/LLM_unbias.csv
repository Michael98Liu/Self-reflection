He was known for his work on Hawking radiation, a theory proposing that black holes emit radiation due to quantum effects.

Hawking also contributed to the understanding of singularities and the information paradox in physics.

He worked extensively on the no-boundary proposal, suggesting that the universe had no beginning and that its laws could be applied from the very start.

Hawking's research on black holes led to the realization that they have a thermal property, with an event horizon being the point of no return.

He also proposed the existence of the ""Hawking temperature"" or the temperature at which a black hole emits radiation.

Hawking demonstrated that quantum mechanics and general relativity should be combined to form a new branch of physics.

His work challenged traditional notions of space and time, and he suggested that the laws of physics can be applied in various states of the universe.

Hawking's cosmological constant research showed that empty space has negative energy density, potentially resolving the energy crisis in the universe.

In 1972, Hawking proved that there is a boundary beyond which the curvature of space becomes singular, but not at a point in time (he initially thought otherwise).

His work on black holes and cosmology remains influential to this day, transforming our understanding of space and the universe."
